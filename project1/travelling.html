	 	<p>This is my first trip without my parents. I was in second school and I went with my friends to the capital of the country to travel. It was a new and memorable trip for a young girl like me at that time</p>

	 	<p>This is a trip to the temple that Vietnamese people often go to with the purpose of praying for good luck for my exam. The special thing about this trip is that it helps me and my father get to know each other better as well as I have the opportunity to see the natural beauty that I have never seen.</p>
