	<h1> XML and JavaScrip</h1>
	<h2> 1. What is XML?</h2>
	<p>XML (Extensible Markup Language) is a markup language similar to HTML but without predefined tags. Just the fundamental format of XML is standardized. So developers define the tags needed for their specific project. </p>
	<h2> 2. How is XML used</h2>
	<p>XML is a versatile format used to store, transport, and exchange structured data between software systems and applications. It is commonly used in web development, data exchange, and configuration files to provide a standardized format for sharing and accessing data across different platforms.</p>
	<h2>3. What does XML look like? (provide an example)</h2>

	<h2>4. What is JavaScript?</h2>
	<p>JavaScript is a scripting language that is used to add interactivity and dynamic behavior to web pages. It is a client-side programming language that runs in a web browser and is used to manipulate the Document Object Model (DOM) of a web page.</p>
	<h2>5. How is JavaScript related to HTML and CSS? </h2>
	<p>HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are the three primary technologies used to create web pages. HTML is used to structure and display content, CSS is used to style and layout the content, and JavaScript is used to add interactivity to the page. JavaScript can be used to manipulate HTML and CSS elements on the page, as well as to respond to user events such as button clicks and form submissions. By combining these technologies, web developers can create rich, dynamic, and interactive web pages that provide a great user experience. For example, a web page can use JavaScript to validate user input on a form, display real-time updates to data, or provide visual effects such as animations and transitions.</p>
	<h2>6. What are some common JavaScript elements, properties, methods, and functions? (provide at least 1 example of each)</h2>
	<p> Elements: <i>document.getElementById('id')</i> - retrieves the element with the specified ID</p>
	<p>	Properties:<i> element.innerHTML </i> - retrieves or sets the HTML content of an elemen</p>
	<p> Methods: <i>alert('message')</i> - displays an alert box with a message</p>
	<p> Function: <i> function addNumbers(a, b) {return a + b;} </i> - adds two numbers and returns the result.</p>
